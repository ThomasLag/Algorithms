In a file bfs.in, the first line contains two integers, n and m.
0 <= n <= 1,000,000
0 <= m <= 1,000,000
separated by a space.
This indicates a graph with n vertices and m edges.
In the next line, two integers are specified, s and t.
0 <= s <= t < n
These indicate a starting vertex and an ending vertex.
The next m lines contain two integers each: a[i], b[i].
These indicate that edge i connects vertices a[i] and b[i]
The output file bfs.out contains one single integer, k
the number of edges required to cross in order to reach from s to t
or -1 if it is not possible to go from s to t.
Note that edge numbering is 0-based and the graph is directed.
